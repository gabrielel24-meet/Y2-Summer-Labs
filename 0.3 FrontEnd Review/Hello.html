		<h1>Guitars</h1>

		<p>The guitar is a stringed musical instrument that is usually fretted (with some exceptions) and typically has six or twelve strings. It is usually held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. <p>

		<h2>Electric guitars</h2>

		<p class="p1">An electric guitar is a guitar that requires external amplification in order to be heard at typical performance volumes. Unlike a standard acoustic guitar. it uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical signals, which ultimately are reproduced as sound by loudspeakers.</p>
